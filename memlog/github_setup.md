# GitHub Repository Setup

## Current Status
- ✅ Local Git repository has been initialized
- ✅ Initial commit has been created with all project files
- ✅ .gitignore has been configured for a Node.js/React project
- ✅ Connected to GitHub repository: https://github.com/KennXion/SocialMediaManager
- ✅ Initial commit pushed to GitHub

## Repository Details
- **Repository URL**: https://github.com/KennXion/SocialMediaManager
- **Default Branch**: main
- **Initial Commit Hash**: 1472fcb

## Git Configuration
- Remote origin has been set to: https://github.com/KennXion/SocialMediaManager.git

## Regular Git Operations

Now that the repository is set up, you can use these common Git commands for your daily workflow:

```bash
# Pull latest changes from GitHub
git pull

# Create a new branch for features
git checkout -b feature/new-feature-name

# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Description of changes"

# Push changes to GitHub
git push

# Merge a feature branch into main (after navigating to main)
git checkout main
git merge feature/new-feature-name
git push
```

## Best Practices for Collaborative Development

1. **Use feature branches**:
   - Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix
   - Keep branches focused on a single task

2. **Write descriptive commit messages**:
   - Use a consistent format (e.g., "Fix: description" or "Feature: description")
   - Explain what and why, not how

3. **Commit frequently**:
   - Make small, logical commits
   - Easier to track changes and roll back if needed

4. **Pull before pushing**:
   - Always pull the latest changes before pushing
   - Reduces merge conflicts

5. **Review before merging**:
   - Check your code for any issues before merging
   - Consider using pull requests for important changes

## GitHub Issues and Project Management

For effective project management:
- Create issues for bugs and feature requests
- Use labels to categorize issues
- Assign issues to team members
- Link commits to issues using #issue-number in commit messages
