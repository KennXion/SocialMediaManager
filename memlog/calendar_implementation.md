# Calendar Implementation

## Overview
We've implemented a modern, intuitive calendar interface for the Social Media Manager using **react-big-calendar**. This provides a professional-looking calendar with proper day cells similar to Google Calendar and other industry-standard calendar applications.

## Components Created

### 1. EventCalendar Component
- **File**: `/frontend/src/components/calendar/EventCalendar.jsx`
- **Description**: The main calendar component that displays scheduled posts in a calendar format.
- **Features**:
  - Month, week, day, and agenda views
  - Custom event styling based on social media platform
  - Custom toolbar with navigation controls
  - Click handling for events and empty calendar slots
  - Responsive design for different screen sizes

### 2. Custom CSS
- **File**: `/frontend/src/components/calendar/calendar.css`
- **Description**: Custom styles to enhance the appearance of the calendar.
- **Features**:
  - Improved day cell styling
  - Better event visualization
  - Responsive design adaptations
  - Enhanced header and toolbar styling

## Integration

The EventCalendar component is integrated into the ContentScheduler page and provides:
- Visual representation of scheduled posts
- Interaction with existing scheduler functions
- Ability to click on events to edit them
- Ability to click on empty slots to schedule new posts

## Dependencies
- **react-big-calendar**: A comprehensive calendar component for React
- **date-fns**: Date utility library for handling dates and times

## Usage
The calendar is used by passing events, along with event handlers for interactions:

```jsx
<EventCalendar
  events={transformedSchedules}
  onEventClick={handleEventClick}
  onSelectSlot={handleSlotSelect}
  onRangeChange={handleRangeChange}
/>
```

## Customization
The calendar is highly customizable:
- Events can be styled based on social media platform
- Day cells can have custom rendering
- The toolbar can be customized for different controls
- Responsive behavior can be adjusted for different screen sizes

## Future Enhancements
Potential future improvements:
- Drag and drop functionality for rescheduling
- Additional views (e.g., timeline view)
- Event grouping for days with many events
- Filtering options by platform or status
