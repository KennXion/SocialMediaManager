# Social Media Management System - Architecture

## System Overview
The Social Media Management System will be a comprehensive tool for managing multiple social media platforms, using AI for content creation and scheduling posts. The system will provide analytics and reporting on engagement metrics.

## Core Components

### 1. Backend
- **API Server**: Handles requests from the frontend, manages authentication, and coordinates between components
- **Database**: Stores user data, platform credentials, scheduled posts, and analytics
- **AI Content Generator**: Creates platform-specific content based on user preferences
- **Scheduler**: Manages timed posting of content
- **Platform Integrators**: Modular components to interact with various social media APIs

### 2. Frontend
- **Dashboard**: Overview of all platform activities and metrics
- **Content Manager**: Interface for creating, viewing, and managing content
- **Scheduler Interface**: Calendar view for scheduling posts
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Visualizations of engagement metrics
- **Platform Settings**: Configuration for each social media platform

### 3. Platform Support (Initial)
- Twitter/X
- Instagram
- Facebook
- LinkedIn
- TikTok
- YouTube

### 4. Extensibility
- Plugin architecture for adding new social media platforms
- API for third-party extensions

## Technology Stack (Proposed)
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI
- **Frontend**: React with Material UI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **AI**: OpenAI API integration for content generation
- **Message Queue**: Redis for scheduling

## Security Considerations
- Secure storage of platform credentials
- OAuth integration for platform authentication
- Rate limiting to prevent API abuse
- Regular security audits
