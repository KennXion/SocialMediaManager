## 2025-04-11: Fixed Missing `removeNotification` Function

### Issue
Error in NotificationsMenu.jsx: `export 'removeNotification' (imported as 'removeNotification') was not found in '../../store/slices/uiSlice'`

### Root Cause
The NotificationsMenu component was trying to use a `removeNotification` function that wasn't defined in the uiSlice.

### Solution
1. Added `removeNotification` reducer to uiSlice.js:
   - Created a function to find and remove a notification by ID
   - Updated the unreadNotifications count if needed
   - Added the function to the exported actions

2. Enhanced NotificationsMenu.jsx:
   - Added dismiss buttons to individual notifications
   - Fixed syntax in the notifications map function (closing tags)

## 2025-04-11: Fixed `schedules.map is not a function` Error and Dark Mode

### Issue
1. Runtime error in ContentScheduler.jsx: `schedules.map is not a function`
2. Dark Mode functionality was missing
3. Gray icons were difficult to see in Dark Mode

### Root Cause
1. The `schedules` variable could be undefined or null when accessed, causing the `.map` function to fail
2. The application was using a static theme without proper theme switching functionality
3. Icon colors weren't being adjusted for Dark Mode

### Solution

#### 1. Fixed schedules.map error with robust defensive programming:
```jsx
// Get Redux state with safe extraction
const schedulesState = useSelector((state) => state.schedules);
  
// Handle possible null or undefined schedules with defensive programming
const schedules = Array.isArray(schedulesState.schedules) ? schedulesState.schedules : [];
const { saving: scheduleSaving, loading: scheduleLoading, error: scheduleError } = schedulesState;
```

#### 2. Implemented proper theme switching:
   - Created a new ThemeProvider component that reads theme from Redux state
   - Implemented dynamic theme creation based on theme mode ('light' or 'dark')
   - Updated index.js to use the custom ThemeProvider

#### 3. Enhanced Dark Mode icons and colors:
   - Added action palette settings for consistent colors in Dark Mode
   - Added component overrides for MuiIconButton to ensure visible icons
   - Added component overrides for MuiSvgIcon to improve visibility of SVG icons
   - Set appropriate contrast colors for all interactive elements
